    - inspection of the sender's IP address with the most reliable zombie RBL;
    - blocking of the bounce e-Mail messages;
    - blocking of e-Mail messages for undisclosed recipients;

Install
=======
  Requirements: Linux/FreeBSD, Sendmail v8.11 and higher compiled with MILTER
support enabled, Sendmail Development Kit, POSIX threads library.

  Edit the Makefile according to version of your Sendmail program and OS.
Edit the config.h file if it is necessary (WHITE_LIST, SYSLOG_FACILITY
parameters). Set your owned domain(s) with the FAKE_HELO parameter.

  Under the root account:
make
make install
/usr/local/sbin/smf-zombie

  Add this milter to start-up scripts before starting the Sendmail daemon.

  Add these lines to your Sendmail configuration file:
define(`confMILTER_MACROS_HELO', confMILTER_MACROS_HELO`, {verify}')dnl
define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM', confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM`, {msg_size}')dnl
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`smf-zombie', `S=unix:/var/smfs/smf-zombie.sock, T=S:30s;R:1m')dnl

  If you have another milters this milter should be the first.
Rebuild your Sendmail configuration file and restart the Sendmail daemon.

  Under Linux add this line to your syslog.conf file and restart the Syslog daemon:
local1.*	-/var/log/zombie-spam.log

  Under FreeBSD run this command: touch /var/log/zombie-spam.log
Then, add these lines to your syslog.conf file and restart the Syslog daemon:
!smf-zombie
local1.*	-/var/log/zombie-spam.log

  It's very recommended to add these lines to your Sendmail configuration file
(if you have up to 1.000.000 incoming messages per month):
define(`confPRIVACY_FLAGS', `goaway,noetrn,nobodyreturn,noreceipts')dnl
define(`confTO_COMMAND', `1m')dnl
define(`confTO_IDENT', `0s')dnl
define(`confTO_RESOLVER_RETRANS', `7s')dnl
define(`confTO_RESOLVER_RETRY', `4')dnl
define(`confMAX_DAEMON_CHILDREN',`256')dnl
define(`confCONNECTION_RATE_THROTTLE',`8')dnl
define(`confBAD_RCPT_THROTTLE', `1')dnl Sendmail v8.12+

  Notes: the successfully authenticated senders will bypass the filtering.
