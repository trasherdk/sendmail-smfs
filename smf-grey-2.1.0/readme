About
=====
  It's a lightweight, fast and reliable Sendmail milter that implements the
Greylisting anti spam technology as proposed by Evan Harris. This technology
can significantly reduce the amount of spam and worms going from zombie hosts,
which may produce up to 80% of world SPAM. This milter has a very effective
Greylisting algorithm on the base of this tuple: sender's IP address
(Class C subnet), envelope sender address and envelope recipient address.
  It's a lite alternative for the milter-greylist, graymilter and milter-gris
milters.

  Features:

    - external editable configuration file;
    - whitelist by an IP address (in CIDR notation);
    - whitelist by a PTR (reverse DNS) record;
    - whitelist by an envelope sender e-Mail address;
    - whitelist by an envelope recipient e-Mail address;
    - whitelists auto reloading;
    - scalable and tunable fast in-memory greylist/autowhitelist engine;
    - autowhitelisted records reloading and regular dumping;
    - SMTP AUTH support;
    - RFC-2821 standard compliance;
    - Greylisting results header builder.

Install
=======
  Requirements: Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris, Sendmail v8.11 and higher compiled with
MILTER API support enabled, Sendmail Development Kit, POSIX threads library.

  Edit the Makefile according to version of your Sendmail program and OS.

  Under the root account:
make
make install

  Inspect and edit the /etc/mail/smfs/smf-grey.conf file.

/usr/local/sbin/smf-grey
or
/usr/local/sbin/smf-grey -c /etc/mail/smfs/smf-grey.conf

  Add this milter to start-up scripts before starting Sendmail daemon.
Look at the contributed samples of start-up scripts.

  Add these lines to your Sendmail configuration file (usually sendmail.mc):
define(`confMILTER_MACROS_HELO', confMILTER_MACROS_HELO`, {verify}')dnl
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`smf-grey', `S=unix:/var/run/smfs/smf-grey.sock, T=S:30s;R:30s')dnl

IMPORTANT: make sure that /var/run is not a group writable directory! If so,
or chmod 755 /var/run, or if it's impossible switch to another directory.

IMPORTANT: make sure that libmilter is compiled with BROKEN_PTHREAD_SLEEP defined.
If this symbol is not defined, libmilter will use sleep() in signal-handler thread,
which may cause various program misbehaviors, including coredumps.
To rebuild Sendmail with this symbol defined, add the following line to your
Sendmail/devtools/Site/site.config.m4:

  APPENDDEF(`confENVDEF', `-DBROKEN_PTHREAD_SLEEP')

If you have the smf-zombie and smf-sav milters installed, the smf-grey milter
should be added after the smf-zombie and smf-sav milters.

Rebuild your Sendmail configuration file and restart Sendmail daemon.

  Under Linux add this line to your syslog.conf file and restart Syslog daemon:
xxx.info	-/var/log/greylist.log

  Under FreeBSD run this command: touch /var/log/greylist.log
Then, add these lines to your syslog.conf file and restart Syslog daemon:
!smf-grey
xxx.info	-/var/log/greylist.log

Where xxx is the corresponded syslog facility from your smf-grey configuration
file.

  If you want to exclude from logging delivery attempts within
the Greylisting time period, set the syslog priority to notice
instead info. They are just will be filtered out by Syslog daemon.

Notes: the successfully authenticated senders will bypass Greylisting.

For the best results consider to use the smf-zombie and smf-sav milters.

It's very useful to add at your Sendmail configuration file these lines:

define(`confPRIVACY_FLAGS', `goaway,noetrn,nobodyreturn,noreceipts')dnl
define(`confTO_COMMAND', `1m')dnl
define(`confTO_IDENT', `0s')dnl
define(`confMAX_DAEMON_CHILDREN', `256')dnl enlarge if it's required
define(`confCONNECTION_RATE_THROTTLE', `8')dnl enlarge if it's required
define(`confBAD_RCPT_THROTTLE', `1')dnl Sendmail v8.12+
FEATURE(`greet_pause', `5000')dnl Sendmail v8.13+

TODO
====
  (min) legitimate e-Mail messages friendly Greylisting technique (v2.2.0);
  (min) multi MX synchronization (v3.0.0);
  (?)   something else? just let me know.

(min) - minor priority;
(med) - medium priority;
(maj) - major priority.
