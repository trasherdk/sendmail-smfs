About
=====
  It's a lightweight, fast and reliable Sendmail milter for ClamAV AntiVirus.
It uses an e-Mail virus scanning engine built into clamd.

  Features:

    - friendly hosts/networks whitelist;
    - scanning of e-Mail messages less than certain size;
    - blocking of the infected e-Mail messages at the DATA stage of SMTP session.

Install
=======
  Requirements: Linux/FreeBSD, Sendmail v8.11 and higher compiled with MILTER
support enabled, Sendmail Development Kit, POSIX threads library, ClamAV.

  Make sure that the clamd daemon is configured and started.

  Edit the Makefile according to version of your Sendmail program and OS.
Edit the config.h file if it is necessary (MAX_SIZE, UNIX_SOCKET, UNIX_PATH and
SYSLOG_FACILITY parameters).

  Under the root account:
make
make install
/usr/local/sbin/smf-clamd

  Add this milter to start-up scripts before starting the Sendmail daemon.

  Add these lines to your Sendmail configuration file:
define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM', confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM`, {msg_size}')dnl
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`smf-clamd', `S=unix:/var/smfs/smf-clamd.sock, T=S:1m;R:1m')dnl

  If you have another milters this milter should be the last.
Rebuild your Sendmail configuration file and restart the Sendmail daemon.

  Under Linux add this line to your syslog.conf file and restart the Syslog daemon:
local7.*	-/var/log/virus.log

  Under FreeBSD run this command: touch /var/log/virus.log
Then, add these lines to your syslog.conf file and restart the Syslog daemon:
!smf-clamd
local7.*	-/var/log/virus.log
